				<dl>
					<dt class="DescTitle">Pre-test:</dt>
					<dd>Practicing answering questions, even incorrectly, before learning the content, will enhance the future learning and improve post-test results more than spending the same amount of time studying.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Spaced practice:</dt>
					<dd> Spacing out study sessions is focusing on a topic for a short period on different days to improve retention and recall more than massed practice. Creating flash cards that can be used for spaced practice and self-quizzing is effective.</dd>
					
					<dt class="DescTitle">The SQ3R Method:</dt>
					<dd>The SQ3R method is a reading comprehension technique that helps students identify important facts and retain information within their textbook. SQ3R (or SQRRR) is an acronym that stands for the five steps of the reading comprehension process:
					<ul>
						<li>Survey Question</li>
						<li>Question</li>
						<li>Read</li>
						<li>Recite</li>
						<li>Review</li>
					</ul>
					</dt>
					<dt class="DescTitle">The Feynman Technique: </dt>
					<dd>This is an efficient method of learning a concept quickly by explaining it in plain and simple terms. It's based on the idea, "If you want to understand something well, try to explain it simply." What that means is, by attempting to explain a concept in our own words, we are likely to understand it a lot faster.</dd>
					<dt class="DescTitle">The PQ4R Method: </dt>
					<dd>This method takes an active approach to learning that improves memorization and understanding of the topic. Similar to the SQ3R method above, PQ4R is an acronym that stands for the six steps in the process</dd>
					<ul>
						<li>Preview</li>
						<li>Question</li>
						<li>Read</li>
						<li>Reflect</li>
						<li>Recite</li>
					</ul>
					</dt>
					<dt class="DescTitle">Mind Mapping: </dt>
					<dd>If you're a visual learner, try mind mapping, a technique that allows you to visually organize information in a diagram. The structure of a mind map is related to how our brains store and retrieve information. Mind mapping your notes instead of just writing them down can improve your reading comprehension. It also enables you to see the big picture by communicating the hierarchy and relationships between concepts and ideas</dd>
